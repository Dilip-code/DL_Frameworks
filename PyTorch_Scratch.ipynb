You can also use `weights=ResNet18_Weights.DEFAULT` to get the most up-to-date weights.\n","  warnings.warn(msg)\n","Downloading: \"https://download.pytorch.org/models/resnet18-f37072fd.pth\" to /root/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/resnet18-f37072fd.pth\n","100%|██████████| 44.7M/44.7M [00:00<00:00, 168MB/s]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"mJQSj2V25e-p"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
